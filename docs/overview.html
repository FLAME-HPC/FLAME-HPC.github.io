Introduction
</H1> 
 
<P> 
The FLAME framework is an enabling tool to create agent-based models that can
be run on high performance computers (HPCs). Models are created based upon a
model of computation called (extended finite) state machines. By defining
agent-based models in this way the FLAME framework can
automatically generate simulation programs that can run models efficiently on
HPCs.

Model Design
</H1> 
 
<P> 
The philosophy of FLAME is to specify an agent-based model as you would specify
software behaviour, as ultimately the execution of the model will be in software.
The behaviour model is based upon state machines which are composed of a number
of states with transition functions between those states. There is a single
start state and by traversing states using the transition functions the machine
executes the functions until it reaches an end state. This happens to each
agent/machine as one time step or iteration is completed. Figure
<A HREF="#fig:iteration_1">1</A> shows a model consisting of two agents each with two
functions run one after the other. A time step or iteration of the model is when
each agent goes from their start state to an end state.

<P> 
Each agent has a memory that holds variables. Transition functions can read and
write to variables in the agent's memory. Communication between agents is
achieved via messages. Transition functions can also read incoming messages and write
outgoing messages. 
 
<P> 
Because FLAME can execute agent models in parallel and on different processors
the coordination of agent function execution depends on the communication
between agents. Communication is synchronous to the agent model which means it
happens at the same time. For agents this means that if an agent function
receives a certain type of message, it cannot be executed until all the messages
of that type have been sent and that they are all ready to be read. This means
that no agent is given priority over reading any input and all agents have
access to the same messages at the same time. This also means that the order
that agents are executed does not matter.
 
<P> 
Because agents can be executed anywhere on a super computer cluster FLAME uses a
broadcast communication method. This means that agents cannot directly send
messages to another agent. Instead the receiving agent must filter messages that
it only needs to read.
 
<P> 
Figure <A HREF="#fig:xmachine">2</A> shows an agent machine with a start state, 
an end state and one transition function from one to the other which has access to the 
agent memory and recieves input messages and produces output messages.

Describing an agent-based model would thus include the following individual
stages for creating a model:
 
<P> 
 
<UL> 
<LI>Identifying the agents and their functions
</LI> 
<LI>Identify the states which impose some order of function execution
</LI> 
<LI>Identify the memory as the set of variables that are accessed by
functions 
<BR>(including possible conditions on variables for the functions to
occur)
</LI> 
<LI>Identify the input messages and output messages of each function 
 
<BR>(including possible filters on inputs)
 
<P> 
</LI> 
</UL> 
 
<P> 
Once a model has been defined using these criteria the implementation of the
agent functions can be written as source code in the C programming language.
FLAME can then use the model description to create a simulation program that
handles agent execution and communication in parallel.

<H2>
Swarm Example
</H2> 
 
<P> 
For example a simple swarm (flocking) model would include an agent for a bird.
Because agents can only communicate via messages in FLAME each bird needs to
have a function that sends out a message with their current location. A second
function is needed to read the messages and update the birds velocity depending
on the other birds locations. A third function then updates the birds location
using the birds new velocity. The three functions required of the bird agent are
then:
 
<P> 
 
<UL> 
<LI>signal - send out current position message
</LI> 
<LI>observe - read position messages from other agents and update velocity
</LI> 
<LI>respond - update position using the current velocity
</LI> 
</UL> 
 
<P> 
The functions occur in this order so states are included to impose this
order, see Figure <A HREF="#fig:swarm_1">3</A>. As a requirement for automatic parallel
execution agents can only enter particular states once during an iteration,
i.e. there cannot be any loops back to a state already entered. This is so that
parallel processes can easily stay synchronised, adding to the efficiently of a
simulation. There can only be one start state per agent, but there can be many
possible end states.

<P> 
Functions can also have conditions. For instance, in
the swarm model, a response function for flying and a response function when
resting on the ground. The condition on the flying response function would be that the
z-axis position of the agent be greater than zero while the resting response
function condition would be when the z-axis position was zero, see Figure
<A HREF="#fig:swarm_2">4</A>.

<P> 
The messages required for communication between agents are a signal message,
which is output from `signal' and input to `observe', see Figure
<A HREF="#fig:swarm_3">5</A>. This message would include the position of the agent that
sent it, see Table <A HREF="#tab:signal_message">1</A>. A feature of swarm models and most
agent-based models is that there is generally a limit on incoming communication. 
In the swarm case this is the perceived distance of sight that an agent can view the location of other
agents. This feature can be added to the model as a filter on inputs to a
function, where the filter is a formula involving the position contained in the
message (the position of the sending agent) and the receiving agent position.

Functions that take a message type as input are only executed once all functions
that output the same message type have finished. One iteration is taken as a
standalone run of a simulation, so once all the functions that have a message
type as an input have been executed, the messages are deleted as they are no
longer required. Messages cannot be sent between iterations.

Finally the memory required by the agent functions include the position of the
agent, and its velocity, as shown in Table <A HREF="#tab:swarm_memory">2</A>.
