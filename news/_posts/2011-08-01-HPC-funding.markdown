title: FLAME project receives two-year EPSRC grant for HPC developments
---
In a recent EPSRC high performance computing (HPC) funding call the FLAME 
project team have been award two-year project, worth over Â£400,000,  to 
improve the computational performance of FLAME applications on large-scale
computing systems such as HECToR making the best use of multi-core processors.
 
The project is a collaboration between Computer Science at Sheffield University 
and the Software Engineering Group at the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.
