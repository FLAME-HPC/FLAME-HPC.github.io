title: FLAME in patient flow modelling project started
---
FLAME is being used in a new partient flow modelling project. The project - a collaboration between STFC, Sheffield University and CMFT - will be using FLAME to simulate the flow of patients through the hospitals A&E Department.

The purpose of this project is to explore the use of agent-based modelling in patient pathway modelling with the A&E Department of the Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CMFT). CMFT have expressed an interest in a real time computer model that could help clinical teams to manage the flow of patients through the A&E Department.

This exploration of an agent-based model is the initial step to providing a such real time and predictive model.

The project is divide into three Phases:

 * Phase I: Specification and Information Gathering
 * Phase II: Model Design and Implementation
 * Phase III: Testing, verification, validation and User trials

The whole project will be 12 months and will at the end deliver a prototype agent-based model of patient pathways of the CMFT environment. CMFT have highlight a number of questions they would like to be able to answer which will drive some of the developments.
